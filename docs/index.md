# Cyber Metrics
*A curated library of actionable security metrics to power your executive reporting.*

The Cyber Metric Library provides a curated list of measurable security indicators. Itâ€™s designed to simplify executive reporting and highlight the maturity of your security controls. This list focuses on technical metrics that are easy to track using commonly available tools.

## How to use this guide

### Types of Metrics

* ![control](https://img.shields.io/badge/CONTROL-1E90FF) A measure that tracks the implementation of actions, processes, or technologies designed to reduce or mitigate risks within the organization.
* ![risk](https://img.shields.io/badge/RISK-DC143C) A measure that provides visibility into existing or potential risks within the organization, helping to assess areas of vulnerability.
* ![performance](https://img.shields.io/badge/PERFORMANCE-32CD32) A measure that evaluates the efficiency and speed with which a team is executing and delivering on control implementations and operational tasks.

#### Examples

- ![control](https://img.shields.io/badge/CONTROL-1E90FF) % of systems with MFA enforced  
- ![risk](https://img.shields.io/badge/RISK-DC143C) % of endpoints with critical vulnerabilities  
- ![performance](https://img.shields.io/badge/PERFORMANCE-32CD32) Time to deploy security patches  


### Framework references

The following frameworks are used in the mapping of metrics

* [ISO 27001:2022](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001)
* [CIS 8.1](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/v8-1)
* [NIST CSF v.2.0](https://csf.tools/reference/nist-cybersecurity-framework/v2-0/)
