# About the Cyber Metrics Library

The Cyber Metrics Library is a resource for cyber security professionals who are in the business of developing security enterprise reporting.  It serves as a tool to help identify appropriate security metrics, as well as provide a link to popular security frameworks.

## How to contribute

Each of the metrics is maintained as a `yaml` file in [Github](https://github.com/massyn/cyber-metrics/tree/main/02-metrics).  You're welcome to create a pull request to add or adjust any metric you think would be helpful.

## Disclaimer

The goal is not to be an exhaustive list of cyber security metrics - that will come with time.  It is however impossible to achieve full compliance from your regulators or auditors by simply following this guide.  It will however provide you a solid foundation to implement security metrics to achieve the majority of your compliance requirements.

!!! warning
    Please validate all metrics against your compliance frameworks.  We cannot provide any guarentee that the list is complete.
