metric_id: vm_posture_patchable
title: Systems without vulnerabilities - exploitable and patchable critical and high
category: Vulnerability Management
type: risk
description: |
  The percentage of systems that have been active in the last 30
  days and that have patchable vulnerabilities providing critical insight
  into the organisation's ability to minimize exposure to known threats and
  effectively reduce the attack surface.
how: |
  Find all active hosts per your vulnerability management system.  Join the
  hosts with the vulnerability database, and filter the vulnerabilities
  on the criteria as defined in the metric definition.
