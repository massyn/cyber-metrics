title: Access Control - Account Deactivation Timeliness
category: Access Control
type: control
description: |
  This metric tracks the percentage of terminated user accounts that are 
  disabled within defined timeframes, ensuring that departing employees 
  or contractors do not retain unauthorized access to enterprise systems 
  and data.
how: |
  Monitor Okta user deactivation events and compare against HR termination 
  data to measure access revocation timeliness. Accounts are considered 
  compliant if they are disabled within the required timeframe (typically 
  same day or within 24 hours of termination).
