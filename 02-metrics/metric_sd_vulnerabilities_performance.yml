title: SDLC - Repositories without exploitable vulnerabilities remediated within SLO
category: Software Development
type: performance
description: |
  The percentage of code repositories in the development pipeline
  that have resolved critical security vulnerabilities within the established
  service level objective (SLO), ensuring that potential threats are mitigated
  in a timely manner to reduce exposure to security risks and maintain
  compliance with security standards.
how: |
  Query the code repository management system to identify all repositories
  with exploitable vulnerabilities. Calculate the percentage of repositories
  without exploitable vulnerabilities against the total number of repositories
  that have resolved critical security vulnerabilities within the established
  service level objective (SLO).
