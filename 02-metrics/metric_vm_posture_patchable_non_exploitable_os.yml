metric_id: vm_posture_patchable_non_exploitable_os
title: Systems without patchable non-exploitable OS vulnerabilities
category: Vulnerability Management
type: risk
description: |
  The percentage of systems that were active in the last 30 days
  that have resolved patchable, non-exploitable operating system vulnerabilities,
  providing insight into the organisation's "Standard Cycle" patching effectiveness
  for vulnerabilities that should be included in regular patching cycles.
how: |
  Find all active hosts per your vulnerability management system. Join the
  hosts with the vulnerability database, and filter the vulnerabilities
  on the criteria as defined in the metric definition (patchable + non-exploitable + OS).
