title: Systems without vulnerabilities - non critical patched in 2 weeks
category: Vulnerability Management
type: risk
description: |
  The percentage of systems that have been active in the last 30
  days and that have resolved non critical vulnerabilities published in the 2 weeks,
  providing critical insight into the organisation's ability to minimize
  exposure to known threats and effectively reduce the attack surface.
how: |
  Find all active hosts per your vulnerability management system.  Join the
  hosts with the vulnerability database, and filter the vulnerabilities
  on the criteria as defined in the metric definition.
