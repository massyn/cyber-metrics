title: SDLC - Repositories without exploitable vulnerabilities
category: Software Development
type: risk
description: |
  The percentage of code repositories free from known security
  flaws, ensuring that development efforts prioritize secure coding practices,
  reduce the risk of breaches, and maintain the integrity of the software
  development lifecycle. This metric is important as it directly impacts the
  organization's ability to deliver secure products and protect against
  potential cyber threats.
how: |
  Query the code repository management system to identify all repositories
  with exploitable vulnerabilities. Calculate the percentage of repositories
  without exploitable vulnerabilities against the total number of repositories.
