  Dormant Identities tracks the number of unused or inactive accounts within
  the organization, providing critical insight into potential security risks
  as dormant accounts are prime targets for unauthorized access and
  exploitation, making their identification and timely deactivation essential
  for reducing the attack surface and maintaining robust access controls.
how: |
  Find all active users from Okta and check their last login date.
  Users are considered compliant if they have logged in within the last 90
  days, ensuring accounts are actively used and not dormant.
